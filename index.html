You have made my job so much easier with all your prompt emails forwarding receipts/invoices and explanations, and I have loved how you have re-organised Googledocs for us. I hope you have a wonderful time in Australia and that this new chapter in your lives will be a great experience and you will find a job working with people you really enjoy. I will definitely miss you.

Everyone has really enjoyed having you here and your contributions across the people, company, the board are all appreciated; especially so in the areas that are harder to articulate. Your contribution into Abletech‚Äôs culture and spirit has been both unexpected and amazing - and we were very fortunate to have found you. Thanks also for following my lonely dot down Te Waipounamu - look forward to seeing you again and best of luck for your next chapter. Sounds exciting!
